# How to Test the Search Box Fix

1. Visit http://localhost:3001/test-search to test the isolated SearchBox component
2. Try typing in the search box and verify that:
   - The debug info updates with your search term
   - The card items filter correctly
   - The clear button appears when there's text

3. Then visit http://localhost:3001/dashboard (if you're logged in) and test the notes search
4. Check browser console for any error messages or debug output

If there are still issues:
- Try clearing browser cache
- Make sure there are no conflicting styles
- Verify that the Input component's onChange handler is working properly

The fixes implemented:
1. Created a dedicated SearchBox component with proper state management
2. Used useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. Added proper debug logging
4. Fixed any potential event handling issues
